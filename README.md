### Project Introduction

In recent months, the Argo company, a leading retailer in the skincare, cosmetics, and haircare industry, has experienced declining sales and a surge in negative customer feedback. The downturn in performance has highlighted the need for an in-depth analysis of the supply chain and supplier performance to identify areas for improvement. Previous evaluations suggested that only two out of the company’s five main suppliers are worth retaining, underscoring the urgency to reassess supplier relationships, product quality, and overall operational efficiency.

As a data analyst, I was tasked with conducting a comprehensive analysis using Power BI to uncover critical insights that could guide strategic decisions and restore the company’s growth. The goal of this analysis was to pinpoint key operational inefficiencies, assess supplier performance, and formulate actionable recommendations to improve product quality, optimize supply chain operations, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction.

### Methodology and Steps Taken

1. **Data Collection and Integration**:
   - I gathered and integrated data related to production volumes, revenue contributions, defect rates, yield rates, inventory turnover, and supply times from various sources.
   - Using Power BI, I consolidated the data into a comprehensive dashboard for visual analysis, allowing for clearer comparisons and patterns identification.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - I developed visualizations to represent critical metrics, such as revenue contribution by product category, inventory turnover rates, defect rates across product types, and production volumes by supplier.
   - The visuals helped in understanding which product categories contributed most to revenue and how supplier performance varied in terms of quality, yield, and cost efficiency.
   - Special attention was given to metrics like product defect rates, production costs, and inspection outcomes to identify areas impacting product quality and customer satisfaction.

3. **Supplier Performance Assessment**:
   - I compared the performance of the two suppliers the company was interested in, focusing on metrics like yield rate, defect rates, and production efficiency.
   - Suppliers with high defect rates and low yield efficiency were flagged for further review, while more reliable suppliers were identified for potential strategic partnerships.

4. **Quality and Inventory Analysis**:
   - Using data on inventory turnover and product defect rates, I analyzed product performance to identify inefficiencies in inventory management and recurring quality issues.
   - This step also involved comparing production costs against yield and defect rates to evaluate the financial impact of low-quality outputs.

5. **Synthesis and Recommendation Development**:
   - Based on the insights from Power BI, I synthesized the findings into key recommendations aimed at enhancing supplier performance, improving product quality, and optimizing inventory management.
   - The recommendations were designed to align with strategic goals and were prioritized based on potential impact and feasibility.

1. **Revenue and Product Performance**:
   - **Revenue Contribution**: Skincare is the highest revenue contributor at 41.83%, followed by Haircare (30.20%) and Cosmetics (27.96%).
   - **Product Purchase Distribution**: Skincare also leads in terms of customer demand, making up 44.97% of purchases, with Haircare at 29.53% and Cosmetics at 25.50%.
   - **Production Volumes**: Skincare has the highest production volume across suppliers, with 8.5K units, followed by Haircare (3.0K) and Cosmetics (2.0K).

2. **Supplier Performance**:
   - **Top Suppliers by Production**: Supplier 2 and Supplier 1 have better performance. Supplier 4, 5, and 3 have significantly lower performance, suggesting lower overall impact.
   - **Yield Rates**: Supplier 1 shows a better yield rate of 39.0% compared to Supplier 2’s 17.3%, indicating more efficiency in converting raw materials into finished products.
   - **Defect Rates and Quality Issues**: Supplier 2 has a notably high defect rate at 51.98% compared to Supplier 1's 48.70%, impacting overall product quality and customer satisfaction.
   - **Inspection Outcomes**: For Supplier 2, 40.91% of products are still pending inspection, with a 22.73% pass rate, while Supplier 1 has a better pass rate of 48.15%.

3. **Product Quality and Costs**:
   - **Defect Rates by Product Type**: Haircare products have the highest defect rate at 25%, followed by Cosmetics at 14% and Skincare at 13%, which aligns with negative customer feedback.
   - **Inventory Turnover**: Skincare leads with an 18.1 turnover rate, suggesting better inventory management, while Cosmetics has the lowest at 8.5, hinting at potential excess stock or low sales velocity.
   - **Production and Shipping Costs**: Supplier 1’s production cost is higher at £1,221.86 compared to Supplier 2’s £915.70. However, Supplier 1's efficiency may justify the higher cost.

4. **Operational Metrics**:
   - **Supply Time**: Both Supplier 1 and Supplier 2 have average supply times of over 2,900 days, a concerning figure that suggests potential reporting errors or extreme inefficiencies.
   - **Production Rates**: Both suppliers maintain similar production rates (around 40 units per hour), highlighting consistency in production speed.

### Recommendations

1. **Focus on High-Performing Suppliers**:
   - Invest in Supplier 1 for its higher yield rate and lower defect rates, even if it comes at a higher production cost. Their more reliable output and quality should help improve product satisfaction and reduce customer complaints.
   - Conduct a detailed review of Supplier 2's operations to identify and address inefficiencies and high defect rates. Consider negotiating stricter quality control terms or reassessing the partnership if quality does not improve.

2. **Optimize Product Offerings**:
   - Prioritize Skincare products in marketing and production given their higher revenue and purchase contribution. Haircare should be closely managed to address quality issues, while Cosmetics may need targeted strategies to reduce excess inventory.

3. **Quality Control Enhancements**:
   - Implement stricter quality control measures across all suppliers, especially Supplier 2, to mitigate the high defect rates in Haircare products. This could involve more rigorous pre-shipment inspections and supplier audits.
   - Develop a comprehensive training program for suppliers on quality management to standardize practices.

4. **Improve Supply Chain and Inventory Management**:
   - Reassess inventory strategies to boost turnover rates for low-performing products like Cosmetics. Implement demand forecasting tools to better align production with actual sales patterns.
   - Investigate and rectify the reported average supply times, as these figures are abnormally high and may be impacting fulfillment efficiency.

### Next Steps

1. **Supplier Engagement and Negotiations**:
   - Schedule meetings with both Supplier 1 and Supplier 2 to discuss quality improvement plans and set new performance benchmarks.
   - If Supplier 2 fails to show signs of improvement in the next quarter, explore alternative suppliers or negotiate penalties for quality and delivery failures.

2. **Customer Feedback and Product Development**:
   - Conduct focus groups or surveys to better understand customer dissatisfaction and tailor product improvements accordingly.
   - Use the feedback to guide product development, particularly for Haircare products with the highest defect rates.

3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
   - Perform a cost-benefit analysis to weigh the advantages of higher production costs with Supplier 1 against potential gains in customer satisfaction and reduced returns or complaints.
   - Assess if investing in supply chain technology (like better inventory management software) could bring long-term savings.

4. **Implementation of Quality Control Systems**:
   - Introduce automated inspection systems or adopt Six Sigma practices to decrease defect rates across the board.
   - Collaborate with suppliers to ensure that quality standards are transparent and achievable.
